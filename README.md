/*Description: 
The program ask the user to enter 2 numbers, 
User input will be check to be validated, 
if a number will store it and is not a number, It will ask the user to enter a number
once both are numbers are validated as numbers, It will move to sum both numbers.*/ 

Reviewer Name:Manuel L.
Reviewer Comments:I like how everything is placed, makes the code look organized and easy to read. The validation works
great because if I try to put somethinf other than whats asked it will say invalid so if will keep asking you untill 
you give the code what it wants
